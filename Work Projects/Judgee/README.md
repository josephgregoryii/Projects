### Usage

This project is for a doctoral student at the University of Oregon for their thesis study.
The concept of the studies is as follows:


You can’t judge a book by its cover. Or can you?


Actually, we judge people all the time. In fact, we’re pretty good at it. As a species, we may have evolved to be particularly adept at judging others. Think about it. It’s adaptive to make snap judgments about whether or not a stranger is friendly or dangerous, happy or sad, hot or not. These judgments inform our future behavior. They help us decide whether to approach or avoid someone new. They help us respond to a friend’s emotional needs. They help us decide whether a new acquaintance is boyfriend or girlfriend material.

In psychology, we have a fancy term for judging others. We call it “impression formation”. And, as I’m sure you’ve heard before, first impressions are everything. Your clothes, your hair, your facial structure and expressions – they all present a picture of you. And people are judging your self-presentation, whether you like it or not. They are deciding if you’re smart, funny, attractive, creative, rude, organized, anxious, and everything in between. They can’t help it. The human brain is built to judge other people.

Unfortunately, people don’t always share their first impressions. Someone somewhere decided that judging others is unseemly. To be clear, we agree that you probably shouldn’t go around calling others fat, ugly, stupid, and lazy. At least, not to their faces.

This creates a problem. It’s quite natural to wonder what others REALLY think of you. But, most people are too polite to give you accurate feedback. So, how can you learn what other people honestly think of you?

We’ve created a platform where you judge others and they judge you. We encourage it. Learning what others think of us helps us grow. Using this app, you decide which feedback you value most. For example, maybe you are already very confident that you are smart and organized, but you are uncertain of whether you come off as attractive and outgoing.

With Judgee, you control the type of feedback you get. For every three people you judge, you’ll earn one credit. Trade in these credits for feedback about you. The cost of feedback might be different for different trait words. For example, it might only cost 1 credit to see if someone else thinks you are reliable, but 2 credits to see if someone else thinks you are attractive. You decide how to spend your credits.
