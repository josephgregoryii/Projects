# Purchase Transaction API

This project was created to use POST and GET requests using a third-party API.

### Login
First, with the proper authentication, the customer inputs the proper criteria to access the API.
Once logged in, an authentication cookie gets stored.

### Post- Login
Once a cookie has been stored, the customer can reload the page and the web app will automatically authenticate their
cookie and proceed to the transaction page

### Transaction Page
Here, the display page contains previous transactions where the customer can also add a new transaction to the right
of the transactions.
